# Project Euler
## Python Solutions

I recently decided I wanted to learn Python. I figured a great way would be to work on Euler programs, which also helps my math and basic programming skills. I wanted to make it a team effort. This is a public repo but I will authorize friends to have write access! (You may have to e-mail me to send the invite.)

https://projecteuler.net/

### Objectives
- Learn Python
- Solve all Project Euler problems using Python 3
- Work collaboratively

### Directions
- Pick any problem you'd like.
- Create a python file {problem#}.py and place in correct folder
- Copy instructions of problem into comment at top of file
- Have fun!

### Committing Changes
- There are no pull requests! If you have write access to the repo you are able to commit freely.
- Please refrain to committing one problem/file at a time.
- Only commit **finished solutions** and do not commit WIP.
- Commit message should adhere to the following naming convention:
    - 123 Solved
    - 123 Re-Solved *(If a solution is faulty and you decide to fix it!)*

## Have fun!
